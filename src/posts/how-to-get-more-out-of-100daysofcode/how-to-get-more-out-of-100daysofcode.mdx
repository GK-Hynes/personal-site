If you've spent any time on programming Twitter, you've come across the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

## Background and Rules

Started by Alexander Kallaway.

Code for one hour every day.
Post about it on social media.
Encourage other programmers.

## 1. Have a plan

Focus on one skill or one technology for the 100 days. I decided I wanted to get better at CSS so I set out to complete the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certificate.

## 2. Encourage other people

It'll make you feel better. You might even make friends.

## 3. Block and mute spam

The #100DaysOfCode hashtag has become a bit of a victim of its own success.
