Gatsby works great as part of the JAMstack, a modern way to build websites and web applications.

Jason Lengstorf has an excellent [introduction to the JAMstack](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/blog/wtf-is-jamstack/).

Briefly, JAMstack (short for JavaScript, APIs and Markup) focuses on

- generating static assets at build time
- deploying those assets to a CDN
- using client-side JavaScript to call 3rd party APIs and serverless functions for dynamic interactions and data
