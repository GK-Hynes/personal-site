Personal webistes are often neglected. In my case, I hadn't touched my personal site in 2 years ðŸ˜¬.

The old site reflected the technologies I was learning at the time. It was a purely static site, with a little bit of JavaScript for interacts and Sass for styling.

The new site reflects where I'm at now, with much more focus on JavaScript. It's a Jamstack site built with Gatsby, MDX and styled-components.

I took comfort from Colby Fayock's post, [You're Allowed to Overengineer Your Blog](https://www.colbyfayock.com/2020/07/youre-allowed-to-overengineer-your-blog/).
