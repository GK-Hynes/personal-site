Personal websites are often neglected. In my case, my site hasn't had a redesign in 2 years ðŸ˜¬.

The old site reflected the technologies I was learning at the time. It was a purely static site, with just a little bit of JavaScript for interactions and Sass for styling.

The new site reflects where I'm at now, with a much greater focus on JavaScript. It's a Jamstack site built with:

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).

Gatsby helps makes the site fast by default, with built-in code splitting and image optimization. Markdown provides a pleasant writing experience, and MDX gives the option to embed React components if I ever want to include extra functionality. styled-components give some of the benefits of Sass, such as nesting and variables, while also keeping the CSS scoped to individual components.

This might be overkill for a personal website, but I took comfort from Colby Fayock's post, when he says [You're Allowed to Overengineer Your Blog](https://www.colbyfayock.com/2020/07/youre-allowed-to-overengineer-your-blog/), especially to solidify the technologies you're learning.

I've also updated my [personal projects](/projects) and made an effort to provide case studies for them. Here I followed Josh W Comeau's [advice on making a more effective portfolio](https://joshwcomeau.com/effective-portfolio/), by fleshing out the project's goals, tech stack, any pain points, and lessons learned.

Lastly, in an attempt to write more, I've added a section for [articles](/writing). Trying to explain concepts clearly in writing should help make those concepts stick, and they might even prove useful for other people.
