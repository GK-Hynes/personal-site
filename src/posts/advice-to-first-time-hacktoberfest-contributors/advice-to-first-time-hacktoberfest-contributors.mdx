Hacktoberfest might be a little trickier for first-time contributors this year. Previously, all you had to do was open 4 pull requests to any open source repository during the month of October. Thanks to a few bad actors making spam pull requests, now only accepted pull requests to participating repos count.

### Step 0 - Get comfortable with GitHub

This might be your first pull request ever. Colt Steele has a 20-minute [GitHub crash course](https://youtu.be/nhNq2kIvi9s).

Twilio's [Open Pixel Art](https://github.com/twilio-labs/open-pixel-art) is a great low-risk way to practice forking a repo, making changes and then making a pull request. All you are doing is changing to colour of one pixel and contributing to some collaborative art.

### Step 1 - Find repos to contribute to

Starting with Hacktoberfest 2020, open source maintainers need to opt into Hacktoberfest and label their repos with the #hacktoberfest topic. There are over 50,000 repos with this topic, covering everything from JavaScript to Python to C++.

### Step 2 - Read the contributing guidelines

Sarah Drasner has some great advice on [contributing to an open source project](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project/)

### Step 3 - Look for issues, or open one

If you've noticed something about a project that could be improved, open an issue. This gives you the opportunity to disucss it with the maintainer(s). They might be happy to have you try to fix it, or they might have plans to do something totally different.

### Step 4 - Focus on one small change

Your pull request should focus on adding or improving one small feature, especially if you are just starting out. This makes it easier for the maintainer to review your code and decide if it's a good idea to merge it in.

If you want to make a number of changes, split them over multiple small pull requests.

### Step 5 - Make sure your fork is up to date

It's very frustrating to spend time preparing a contribution only to run into a merge conflict becasue your fork is out of sync with the original repo.

Rane Wallin has an excellent article on [keeping your forked repo current](https://dev.to/ranewallin/how-to-keep-your-forked-repository-current-38mn).

### Step 6 - Describe what your pull request is trying to do

Create a new branch in your repo and give it a descriptive name that relates to the topic of your pull request. If you are addressing an open issue, mention this in your pull request.
