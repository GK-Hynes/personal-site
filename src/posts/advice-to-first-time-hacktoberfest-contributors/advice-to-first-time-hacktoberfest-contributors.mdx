Hacktoberfest might be a little trickier for first-time contributors this year. Previously, all you had to do was open 4 pull requests to any open source repository during the month of October. This was very convenient for contributors but meant that maintainers often had to deal with a lot of low-quality spam pull requests.

Now maintainers can choose if they want to opt into Hacktoberfest, and pull requests need to be accepted to count towards your Hacktoberfest total. This means contributors need to work a bit harder, but ultimately it should help protect maintainers from spam and help contributors to make more meaningful contributions.

So here's some advice on making your first Hacktoberfest contribution.

### Step 0 - Get comfortable with GitHub

Hacktoberfest might involve your first ever pull request. Maybe you're not super comfortable with forking repos and opening pull requests, or even with GitHub in general. If that's the case, Colt Steele has a 20-minute [GitHub crash course](https://youtu.be/nhNq2kIvi9s) that should help.

A great low-risk way to practice the workflow of forking a repo, making a change, and then making a pull request is Twilio's [Open Pixel Art](https://github.com/twilio-labs/open-pixel-art) project. All you are doing is changing the colour of one pixel and contributing to some collaborative art, so you can focus on making the pull request rather than worrying about if your code is good enough.

### Step 1 - Find repos to contribute to

Even though Hacktoberfest is now opt-in, there are still over 50,000 repos labelled with the topic, covering everything from JavaScript to Python to C++. It can be pretty overwhelming trying to find something to fit your interests and abilities.

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=hacktoberfest) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/t/hacktoberfest) are both good places to search for maintainers who are looking for contributors, or even events organized to help get contributors involved.

If there are developers that you admire, see if they have any projects that are open to Hacktoberfest contributors.

### Step 2 - Read the contributing guidelines

Open source projects will often have guidelines for contributors in their `README.md`, or if they're very organized, in a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file. Before you do anythign else, read this and make sure you follow any conventions that they reqest.

If the project you're interested in doesn't have clear guidelines, Sarah Drasner has some great advice on [how to contribute to an open source project](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project/) in a respectful and helpful manner.

Remember, you're doing this to help the open source project, not just to get a t-shirt.

### Step 3 - Look for issues, or open one

If you've noticed something about a project that could be improved, open an issue. This gives you the opportunity to discuss it with the maintainer(s). They might be happy to have you try to fix it, or they might have plans to do something totally different.

Sometimes maintainers will open issues themselves to highlight features they would like to add but don't have the time to do right now. Offering to fix these issues is a great way to help out maintainers, and makes it more likely that your pull request will be accepted.

If your pull request is fixing an open issue, make sure to reference this issue. GitHub have instructions on [how to link a pull request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).

### Step 4 - Focus on making one small change

Your pull request should focus on adding or improving one small feature. This makes it easier for the maintainer to review your code and decide if it's ready to be merged in.

If you want to make a number of changes, split them over multiple small pull requests. Maybe also space them out over a few days so you don't bombard the maintainer with notifications.

### Step 5 - Make sure your fork is up to date

It's very frustrating to spend time preparing a contribution only to run into a merge conflict becasue your fork of the repo is out of sync with the original.

Rane Wallin has an excellent article on [keeping your forked repo current](https://dev.to/ranewallin/how-to-keep-your-forked-repository-current-38mn) so you can avoid this headache.

### Step 6 - Make a descriptive pull request

Time to make your contribution. Create a new branch in your fork of the repo and give it a descriptive name that relates to the topic of your pull request. If you are addressing an open issue, mention this in your pull request. Chris Beams has an article on [how to write a git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) that is still relevant despite being a few years old. All of this gives context to the maintainer and helps them to make a decision about your pull request.

One last thing, don't feel bad at all if a maintainer asks you to make changes and resubmit your pull request. It's all part of the process.

Happy hacking!
