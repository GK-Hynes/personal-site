### Project Purpose and Goal

When I was first learning to code, the Pomodoro tecnique was really helpful in getting me to focus and get work done. You complete a session (usually 25 minutes), then take a short break (say 5 minutes), and after you've completed a group of sessions you take a longer break.

I built the first version of this app while completing [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Frontend Libraries certificate, which focuses on React. The user stories for that project included:

- You can start, pause, and reset the timer.
- You can change the length of the session or break.
- An alarm sounds after each session or break.
- The timer automatically switches to a new session or break once the current one is completed.

In addition I added an animated progress circle using SVG to give visual feedback on how long was left.

A few months later I rewrote it to use React hooks instead of class-based components and add new features:

- You can choose between a session, short break and longer break.
- The break is set to at least fifteen minutes after every four completed sessions.

### Tech Stack

While this project could have been written in just JavaScript, React, especially React hooks, provided a way to connect

Gatsby
SVG

### Problems and Thought Process

This app required keeping track of multiple changing values: session and break lengths, time left, and the type of timer currently running. The `useState` hook provided a straightforward way to keep track of and update the individual pieces of state.

Working with `setInterval`. Basically you need to run it inside useEffect.

Animating the progress circle SVG.

```js
const perimeter = 150 * 2 * Math.PI;
const dashOffset = (perimeter * timeLeft) / timerDuration - perimeter;
```

### Lessons Learned

Better understanding of functional components with hooks vs class-based components
A better understanding of `setInterval`
Experience working with SVGs
