### Project Purpose and Goal

When I was first learning to code, the Pomodoro tecnique was really helpful in getting me to focus and get work done. I built the first version of this while completing freeCodeCamp's Frontend Libraries certificate, then rewrote it to use React hooks and allow users to choose between a session, a short break and a longer break.

### Tech Stack

React
Gatsby
SVG

### Problems and Thought Process

Handling multiple session and break lengths.
Animating the progress circle SVG.

### Lessons Learned

Better understanding of functional components with hooks vs class-based components
A better understanding of setInterval
Experience working with SVGs
