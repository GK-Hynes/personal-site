### Project Purpose and Goal

I was looking for a project to build to practice working with APIs in React. Since my wife is a huge NASA fan (she has the ISS Tracker app on her phone), I decided to use NASA's [Astronomy Picture of the Day API](https://api.nasa.gov/) to make her an app to view some of NASA's amazing photography.

I chose Gatsby to build the app since it's a technology I want to get better at and it makes it pretty painless to make your app a PWA.
