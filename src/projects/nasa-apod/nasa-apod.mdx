### Project Purpose and Goal

This project came about because two things coincided. I was looking to practice working with APIs in React and I wanted to make an app for my wife. Since my wife is a huge NASA fan (she has the ISS Tracker on her phone), I decided to use NASA's [Astronomy Picture of the Day API](https://api.nasa.gov/) to make her an app to view some of NASA's stunning photography.

I chose to build the app with Gatsby since it's a technology I want to get better at, plus it makes it pretty painless to turn your app into a PWA.

### Tech Stack

React
Gatsby
react-datepicker
Axios

### Problems and Thought Process

Working with 3rd party React components

Handling API errors

Loading states and user experience

### Lessons Learned

A better understanding of useEffect
Working with Axios vs the fetch API
